# Gilded Rose Kata

This Kata is a Kotlin-port
from [Emilie Bache's Github Repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

The Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/#!/TerryHughes). It is already
on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also Bobby
Johnson's [description](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/) of
the kata.

To build the project and run the test on the command line, use `./gradlew build`.

The tests from [`GildedRoseTest`](./src/test/kotlin/com/gildedrose/GildedRoseTest.kt) are taken from
this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/xpmatteo/5243745.js).

You might want to delete these test and write the for yourself based
on [the requirements](#gilded-rose-requirements) befor you start with the refactoring.

The [`GildedRoseTextTest`](./src/test/kotlin/com/gildedrose/GildedRoseTextTest.kt) is inspired
by [text-based approval testing](https://github.com/texttest/texttest). This test does not reveal
any domain logic but does provide 100% coverage. You can use this test as a safty net and try to
discover the domain logic only by applying structural refactorings.

## Gilded Rose Requirements

These requirements are taken
from [Emilie Bache's Github Repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest
goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by
date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense
type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our
system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

* All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
* All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
* At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

* Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
* The Quality of an item is never negative
* "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
* The Quality of an item is never more than 50
* "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
* "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches; Quality
  increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality
  drops to 0 after the concert

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

* "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the `UpdateQuality` method and add any new code as long as
everything still works correctly. **However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those
belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in
shared code ownership.** (You can make the `UpdateQuality` method and Items property static if you
like, we'll cover for you.)

Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however "Sulfuras" is
a legendary item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.
